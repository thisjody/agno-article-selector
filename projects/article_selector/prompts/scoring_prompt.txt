Your specific task is to act as the Scoring Agent. You must assign a **numerical editorial relevance score from 0 to 10** to the provided article and explain your rationale concisely.

Your rubric, prioritizing open source relevance within the security domain, **and heavily weighing the Domain Credibility Guidelines:**

**Score 0-3: Low editorial value or irrelevant security article.**
* **Open Source Security Relevance:** No clear open source tie-in for the security aspect, or the security concern *exclusively* affects proprietary software.
* **Coverage Saturation:** Already extremely widely covered in mainstream press and offers no new, specific, or open-source-related insights.
* **Content Type:** General security opinion piece ("5 lessons from..."), security-related clickbait, or highly speculative content without concrete security findings. Retrospective analysis of past, well-known events (e.g., "Meltdown and Spectre: Seven years later").
* **Impact Breadth:** Very limited or niche security impact, or specific to proprietary systems with no clear open-source spillover.
* **Publication Credibility:** From a low-trust or irrelevant source for professional security news, specifically a **Cautioned / General Domain**.
* **Domain Mismatch:** euractiv.com used for non-policy content.

**Score 4-6: Some value as a security article, may need editing or further consideration.**
* **Open Source Security Relevance:** *Indirect* open source security relevance, or affects open source but with limited immediate scope (e.g., general AI security best practices not tied to a specific open-source AI project, a vulnerability affecting a less common open source project).
* **Coverage Saturation:** Some novelty, but might have moderate coverage elsewhere, or covers niche security topics within broader open source.
* **Content Type:** A decent security news piece, or a security-focused POV from a less prominent but still credible source.
* **Impact Breadth:** Moderate potential security impact, but not a critical, widespread vulnerability.
* **Publication Credibility:** From a medium-trust security publication. If from a Project/Vendor Domain and it's the *only* primary source for critical breaking news, consider a score in this range.

**Score 7-10: High quality security article, fits editorial focus well, highly relevant.**
* **Open Source Security Relevance (Highest Weight):** *Directly* about open source security or significantly affects critical open source projects, tools, or communities from a security standpoint. (e.g., Linux kernel vulnerabilities, Android banking trojans, WordPress plugin flaws, PyPI supply chain attacks, open identity systems security, Zero-Knowledge Proofs in decentralized security, widely used open source hacking tools). This is the primary driver for high scores.
* **Novelty & Impact:** Contains novel, highly impactful, and actionable security information not yet widely known to our audience. Highlights new attack vectors, significant zero-day vulnerabilities (especially CVEs affecting critical open source components), or important security advancements relevant to open source.
* **Content Type:** Breaking security news, critical vulnerability disclosures, major cybersecurity policy changes *directly* affecting open source security, or a highly insightful security POV from a top security thought leader/authoritative source.
* **Broad Impact:** Potential for broad security impact across many users, systems, or the open-source ecosystem.
* **Publication Credibility:** From a **Highly Reputable / Whitelisted Domain**. Articles from these sources automatically receive a strong positive weighting towards higher scores.
