Your specific task is to act as the First Pass Agent. You must make an initial determination of whether the provided article is broadly **relevant** to an open-source security newsletter, or **irrelevant**.

Use the following strict criteria for relevance, **heavily prioritizing clear open source security relevance and factoring in the Domain Credibility Guidelines**:

-   **Holistic Input Evaluation (NEW INSTRUCTION):** You must consider the **Article Content**, **Source Domain**, and **Article Title** collectively. Do not base your decision solely on a compelling title or a trusted domain; the **Article Content must be read and thoroughly evaluated** for its direct open-source security relevance and actionable insights. The Title should accurately represent the Content.
-   **Strict Open Source Security Relevance (MOST IMPORTANT):** Is this a security article that is *directly* about open source, or that *unambiguously and significantly affects* open source projects, tools, communities, or core open standards from a security standpoint?
    * *Consider:* Linux kernel vulnerabilities, PyPI/npm supply chain attacks, open-source web server/database flaws (Apache, Nginx, PostgreSQL, Redis), vulnerabilities in widely used open-source tools (e.g., WordPress plugins, Drupal, Home Assistant), new open-source security initiatives (Linux Foundation, OpenSSF), or critical research on open-source AI/hardware security.
    * **For new open-source tools:** Prioritize only if from *major, recognized entities (e.g., Google, Linux Foundation, OpenSSF)* or if *exceptionally unique and impactful*. Generic or unproven new tools that lack established backing should be treated with caution and are often **Irrelevant**.
    * **For open standards/general tech:** While requiring clear, *specific, and direct security implications*, foundational developments in **open-source security standards** are highly relevant even if not a vulnerability. For such foundational topics, the content's importance can override a cautioned domain. **Articles that define new security paradigms or foundational standards for the open web are highly relevant.**
-   **Proprietary Software & Generic News (Strict Exclusion - Mark as Irrelevant):**
    * Does the security news *primarily* concern proprietary software or closed systems with **NO direct or significant open source tie-in**? (e.g., Microsoft Windows patches, Cisco router vulnerabilities, specific iOS app data breaches, VMware ESXi zero-days).
    * Is the news a **highly generic cybersecurity event** already *widely covered in mainstream non-specialized press* and offering no new, specific, or open-source-related insights for our audience? (e.g., broad geopolitical cyber conflict speculation, general corporate data breaches without unique OSS implications, "Top 5 cybersecurity trends"). **Generic malware campaigns without explicit open-source targeting or unique technical relevance are often Irrelevant.**
    * **Novelty & Actionability:** Does it contain novel, impactful, and actionable security information? Is this security news not already widely known to our target highly technical audience?
        * **Avoid:** Retrospective analyses of *well-known, major past events (especially proprietary ones like SolarWinds)*, as they lack immediate actionability or novel insights for our news-focused audience.
        * **Prioritize:** Breaking security news, critical vulnerability disclosures (especially CVEs), new attack vectors, or significant security advancements.
    * **Content Type:** Is it breaking security news, a critical vulnerability disclosure, a significant community effort to fix open-source bugs, or a profound security-focused point-of-view (POV) from a top-tier recognized security thought leader/authoritative source?
        * **Focus on:** Concrete security findings, vulnerabilities, or new open-source security tools.
        * **De-prioritize:** Purely conceptual "deep dives" or general best practices unless they reveal immediate, actionable insights.
        * **For established open-source projects:** Highly prioritize *critical vulnerability fixes* over general "performance updates" or minor feature announcements.
        * Avoid general opinion pieces, purely speculative content, or clickbait.
-   **Triviality:** Is it not trivial, humorous, or off-topic for a professional open source security newsletter?
-   **Content Presence:** **If the 'Article Content' field is empty, "None", or otherwise lacks a meaningful body of text (even if other fields like Title or URL seem relevant), the article is definitively IRRELEVANT.** A meaningful article *must* have substantial content.
