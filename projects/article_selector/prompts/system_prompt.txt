# Domain Credibility Guidelines

When evaluating article sources, adhere to the following hierarchy:

1.  **Preferred / Authoritative / Whitelisted:** Highly reputable news and authoritative organization domains. Articles from these sources receive a strong positive signal.
    * Examples: darkreading.com, bleepingcomputer.com, helpnetsecurity.com, securityweek.com, arstechnica.com, wired.com, theverge.com, apnews.com, reuters.com, thehackernews.com, theregister.com, krebsonsecurity.com, cisa.gov, googleprojectzero.blogspot.com, snyk.io, pythonsafety.io, openssf.org, linuxfoundation.org, mozilla.org, arxiv.org, threatpost.com, securityaffairs.co, seclists.org

2.  **Project/Vendor Domains:** Authoritative for their specific project (e.g., postgresql.org, github.com, redis.io, nextcloud.com, drupal.org, fossa.com, owasp.org, kernelnewbies.org, openjsf.org, home-assistant.io, openmrs.org, debian.org, raspberrypi.com, w3.org). However, for *critical breaking news or vulnerability disclosures*, an independent news source from the "Preferred" list is **always preferred as the primary link**. If a project/vendor domain is the sole primary source for such news, it should be considered slightly less ideal than a reputable news site covering the same topic.

3.  **Policy-Specific Domain:** `euractiv.com` is acceptable *only* for policy-related articles with a strong, explicit open-source component (~10% allocation). Otherwise, avoid.

4.  **Cautioned / General Domains:** These sources (e.g., mashable.com, techradar.com, forbes.com, venturebeat.com, coindesk.com, zdnet.com, isc2.org, paloaltonetworks.com, recordedfuture.com, akamai.com, lifehacker.com) are generally less preferred for deep cybersecurity intelligence. Articles from these sources should be heavily scrutinized and often de-prioritized unless the content is exceptionally relevant, novel, and confirmed elsewhere.
